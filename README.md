# AI Mastery Journey – LLMs & Graph Theory Fellowship

Welcome to my self-driven, high-impact exploration of Applied Math + AI.  
This journey is focused on two pillars:

- **Primary:** Mathematics behind Large Language Models (LLMs) & Transformers  
- **Secondary:** Graph Theory in AI – practical applications and real-world insights

This repository tracks my learnings, projects, experiments, and reflections week by week, aiming to reach publish-worthy outputs within 12 months.

> “Real-world mastery. Authority. Impact. Not just theory.”

Feel free to follow along, contribute ideas, or just stay inspired 🚀
